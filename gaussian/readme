"gaussian_xx.com" is a template for generating an input file for Gaussian09/16.

The following flags are needed in the template,

#coordinate#
#charge#
#elec_field#

which are used to let GENESIS notice where the coordinates of QM atoms, MM 
charges, and points to calculate the electric field, respectively, should 
be written.

gaussian_01.com
  Sample for minimization. Micro-iteration requires pop=mk.

gaussian_02.com
  Sample for vibration (harmonic).

gaussian_03.com
  Sample for using customized basis sets (gen keyword). The basis sets 
  must be specified between #charge# and #elec_field#.

gaussian_04.com
  Sample for energy calc. without force. This is used for generating 
  grid potential in anharmonic calc. Note that #elec_field# is still
  needed.
