"gaussian_xx.com" is a template for generating an input file for Gaussian09/16.
We use a flag

#coordinate#
#charge#
#elec_field#

to notice the program where the coordinates of QM atoms and MM charges should 
be printed.

gaussian_01.com
  Sample for minimization. Micro-iteration requires pop=mk

gaussian_02.com
  Sample for vibration (harmonic).

gaussian_03.com
  Sample for using customized basis sets (gen keyword). The basis sets 
  must be specified between #charge$ and #elec_field#.

gaussian_04.com
  Sample for energy calc. without force. This is used for generating 
  grid potential in anharmonic calc. Note that #elec_field# is still
  needed.
