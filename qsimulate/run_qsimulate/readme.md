# Script files to run QSimulate-QM/GENESIS

## Description
GENESIS and QSimulate-QM are lined with dynamic libraries, so 
"qmexe" is not required. 

- genesis_qsimulate.sh  
  This file shows how to run GENESIS/QSimulate-QM through singularity.
  The singularity image (QSimulate-QM.sif) is provided by QSimulate upon 
  the purchase of the software. Singularity (ver 3.7 or newer) and Intel 
  MPI are required.
